{"comment":"#  The implementation of list_files and list_file might seem very #  complex, but it was arrived at after a lot of toil. The main design decision #  made here is that the user should be able to pass many different types of #  string to list_files and get a consistent result: a list of local #  filenames. (One additional wrinkle is that there are two functions, #  list_files and list_file. This is to ensure that #  list_file is only ever called with a length 1 argument, even though it #  can return multiple filenames. For the purposes of this explanation, this #  distinction is elided). #  There are four possible types of values for x #     - a simple filename #     - a remote URL #     - a glob pattern #     - a vector of some combination of the above #  list_files has a recursive design, because  some of these arguments #  can resolve to arguments which need further processing: e.g. a remote URL #  could resolve to a zip file which needs to be extracted. The termination #  condition for the recursion is when the argument passed is a local filepath #  which refers to a single file and needs no further processing, e.g. something #  like '\/path\/to\/text.tsv'. However, it is not possible to determine if a given #  argument is a path to a single file or a glob pattern which matches multiple #  files, without actually trying the match. This matters because if it's the #  result of a globbing expression, then it could potentially need further #  processing, but if it's not, it the recursion needs to end. We can't know #  beforehand because the rules for globbing are implementation-dependent #  (systems might treat '\/path\/to\/file\\*.tsv' as either a filename or a path #  depending on  whether they support escaping of glob wildcards. We could have #  tested the return value from Sys.glob to see whether the system treats a #  given string as a glob pattern or a simple filename. Unfortunately, #  Sys.glob() will return character(0) for either a glob pattern which matches #  no files, or a non-glob filename for a file that doesn't exist, so that #  doesn't work either. We also can't test whether a pattern is a regular file #  by looking at the extension, because '\/path\/to\/*.zip' is a glob expression #  with a 'zip' extension.","label":3}
