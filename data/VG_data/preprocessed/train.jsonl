This is to ensure that #  list_file is only ever called with a length 1 argument, even though it #  can return multiple filenames.

The termination #  condition for the recursion is when the argument passed is a local filepath #  which refers to a single file and needs no further processing, e.g. something #  like '\/path\/to\/text.tsv'. However, it is not possible to determine if a given #  argument is a path to a single file or a glob pattern which matches multiple #  files, without actually trying the match.
